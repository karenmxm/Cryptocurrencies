# Cryptocurrencies

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrencies investment portfolio for its customers. The company asks us to present a report of what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how cryptocurrencies could be grouped toward creating a classification for developing this new investment product. We removed non-trading cryptocurrencies in the cryptocurrencies data and predict four clusters using PCA to reduce dimention and unsupervised learning K-means algorithm from sklearn.
