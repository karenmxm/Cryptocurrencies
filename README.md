# Cryptocurrencies

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrencies investment portfolio for its customers. We present a report of what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how cryptocurrencies could be grouped toward creating a classification for developing this new investment product. 

## Unsupervised Learning (K-means) and Feature Reduction (PCA)
We removed non-trading cryptocurrencies in the cryptocurrencies data and predicted four clusters using PCA to reduce dimention and unsupervised learning K-means algorithm from sklearn.
